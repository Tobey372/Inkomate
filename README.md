# Inkomate

## .NET C# program to manage incontinence aids of residents of nursing homes

### *Expect first full release (v1.0.0) in January ~ February*

### v0.9.x - working 

Improvemnts have been made, making this program almost ready for its first major release. All currently implemented functions have been working without bugs during testing - however, since this program is not fully released  yet, expect it to break rare occasions. 

### ToDo

- Add English support \*
- Code clean-up \*
- Remove generic allowance value - make it per insurance \*
- Add functions for insurances (add, remove, update etc.) \*
- Comment & explain code
- Creating installer
- Reducing redundant code (e.g. database-handler) \*
- SQL server / MySQL compatibility
- Select location of SQLite file \*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *\* mandatory for full release*

### Problems

- ~~Depending on the system language the final .csv file might include wrongly formated text or delimiter in other languages~~

### Dev problems

- Fix VS property file
- SQLite NuGet packages break if solution is built for the first time (reinstall these packages fixes this problem)

### Database

This project uses a SQLite database. An associated SQL file is provided in order to create the tables of this database. The database file must be named "inkomate.sqlite" and must reside 3 folders above executable. This can be changed in code however 

### Patch notes

- Fixed several bugs 
- Added search function
- Improved sorting function
- Added QOF features (e.g. displaying the count of current residents)
- Fixed .csv cultural problems
